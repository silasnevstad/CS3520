Question 5 - Assume that your computer uses 12-bits registers to represent numbers. If your computer can, what would be its 2â€™s complement binary representation for -13, 56, -1, -2048, 2048. 

12-bits 2's complement representation for -13:
-13 in decimal can be converted to binary using the method of successive division by 2.
-13 / 2 = -6 R 1
-6 / 2 = -3 R 0
-3 / 2 = -2 R 1
-2 / 2 = -1 R 0
So the binary representation of -13 is 1101.
To find the 2's complement, we invert all the bits, and add 1 to the result.
1101 -> 0010 + 1 -> 0011
So, -13 in 12-bits 2's complement is 111111110011.

12-bits 2's complement representation for 56:
56 in decimal can be converted to binary using the method of successive division by 2.
56 / 2 = 28 R 0
28 / 2 = 14 R 0
14 / 2 = 7 R 0
7 / 2 = 3 R 1
3 / 2 = 1 R 1
1 / 2 = 0 R 1
So the binary representation of 56 is 000000111000.

12-bits 2's complement representation for -1:
-1 in decimal can be converted to binary using the method of successive division by 2.
-1 / 2 = -1 R 1
So the binary representation of -1 is 1.
To find the 2's complement, we invert all the bits, and add 1 to the result.
1 -> 0 + 1 -> 1
So, -1 in 12-bits 2's complement is 111111111111.

12-bits 2's complement representation for -2048:
-2048 in decimal can be converted to binary using the method of successive division by 2.
-2048 / 2 = -1024 R 0
-1024 / 2 = -512 R 0
-512 / 2 = -256 R 0
-256 / 2 = -128 R 0
-128 / 2 = -64 R 0
-64 / 2 = -32 R 0
-32 / 2 = -16 R 0
-16 / 2 = -8 R 0
-8 / 2 = -4 R 0
-4 / 2 = -2 R 0
-2 / 2 = -1 R 0
So the binary representation of -2048 is 100000000000.
To find the 2's complement, we invert all the bits, and add 1 to the result.
100000000000 -> 011111111111 + 1 -> 10000000000.
So, -2048 in 12-bits 2's complement is 10000000000.

12-bits 2's complement representation for 2048:
2048 cannot be represented in the 2's complement format using a 12-bit register. 
The maximum positive value that can be represented using a 12-bit register in 2's complement format is 2^11 - 1 = 2047, 
which is 011111111111 in binary. 2048 exceeds this limit.
