The C++ program calculated Fibonacci numbers for inputs 31, 40, and 45 using both parallel and sequential executions on a computer with 8 cores. The parallel execution used three threads with IDs 0x309d06000, 0x309d89000, and 0x309e0c000, taking 7189 milliseconds, while the sequential execution took 7821 milliseconds. The parallel execution was faster by 632 milliseconds, showcasing the benefits of multi-threading. The performance difference is due to efficient utilization of the 8 processor cores, allowing multiple threads to run simultaneously and perform tasks concurrently.
